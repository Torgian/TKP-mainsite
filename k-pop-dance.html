      <p>The 27th of August 2014 our first ever event was held, at Nalen, Stockholm. Top SM Entertainment choreographer Mihawk Back came to Stockholm to teach some of his latest creations to Swedish K-Pop fans, as part of  Mihawk's European Dance Workshop Tour in the UK, Norway and Sweden.  </p>

      <p>The workshop was divided into two groups, one for beginner dancers and one for advanced.  </p>

      <p>The first group of participants got to learn the choreography to the live-version intro of world famous K-Pop group EXO's 2014 title track Overdose. Originally performed by EXO member and main dancer KAI, this powerful choreography had the participants working up a sweat in the workshop's beginners' class.  </p>

      <p>The second group of participants was taught the powerful breakdown choreography for one of SHINee member Taemin's solo debut songs – Pretty Boy. At an intermediate-advanced level, this really pumped up the pulse of the dancers as they impressively learned this fierce choreography during their two hour workshop.   </p>

      <p>After the dance workshops, all participants also had the opportunity to take part in a Mihawk Back fan-meeting, where the celebrity choreographer answered questions sent in by his fans.  </p>

      <p>The event was later featured in an article on Hallyu.se's website, as well as on Swedish television in a segment of “Lilla Aktuellt” - a news broadcasting show for the younger audiance.  </p>

      <p>All in all, the event was a great success and we at TK Entertainment would like to thank Mihawk Back for this wonderful opportunity to have worked with him, and of course we also want to thank every person who participated. We hope to see you all again!   </p>
